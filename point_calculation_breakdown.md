## Key Points About Carlos's Score

**Carlos has 8 total points:**
- **4 points from Wild Card Round** (4 correct winners out of 6 games)
- **4 points from Divisional Round** (2 correct matchups with correct winners: DEN vs BUF and NE vs HOU)

**Important:** Carlos did NOT have 8 points before the NE vs HOU game. He had:
- 4 points from Wild Card
- 2 points from DEN vs BUF (first divisional game)
- **= 6 points before NE vs HOU**

After NE vs HOU:
- 6 points (previous total)
- + 2 points from NE vs HOU
- **= 8 total points**

The calculation is correct: Carlos earned 2 points from each of the two AFC divisional games he got right, for a total of 4 divisional points.

## 🏆 CARLOS - Current: 8 Points | Maximum: 15 Points

### ✅ CAN WIN THE POOL

**Current Status:**
- Has the correct matchups for both Conference Championships ✓
- Has a path to victory in multiple scenarios

**Their Picks:**
- **NFC Championship:** SEA vs CHI → **CHI** (Chicago Bears)
- **AFC Championship:** DEN vs NE → **DEN** (Denver Broncos)
- **Super Bowl:** SEA vs DEN → **DEN** (Denver Broncos)

**What Needs to Happen for Carlos to Win:**

Carlos can win in **6 different scenarios**. Here are the key paths:

1. **Best Case Scenario (15 points):**
   - NFC: SEA wins (Carlos gets 0 pts - he picked CHI) → 8 + 0 = 8 points
   - AFC: DEN wins (Carlos gets 3 pts) → 8 + 3 = 11 points
   - Super Bowl: DEN vs SEA → DEN wins (Carlos gets 4 pts - correct matchup and winner!) → 11 + 4 = 15 points
   - **Total: 15 points** ⭐

2. **If CHI wins NFC and DEN wins AFC:**
   - NFC: CHI wins (Carlos gets 3 pts) → 8 + 3 = 11 points
   - AFC: DEN wins (Carlos gets 3 pts) → 11 + 3 = 14 points
   - Super Bowl: DEN vs CHI → DEN wins (Carlos gets 0 pts - wrong matchup, he picked SEA vs DEN) → 14 + 0 = 14 points
   - Super Bowl: DEN vs CHI → CHI wins (Carlos gets 0 pts) → 14 + 0 = 14 points
   - **Total: 14 points** (still wins since no one else can score more than 10)

3. **If SEA wins NFC and DEN wins AFC:**
   - NFC: SEA wins (Carlos gets 0 pts - he picked CHI) → 8 + 0 = 8 points
   - AFC: DEN wins (Carlos gets 3 pts) → 8 + 3 = 11 points
   - Super Bowl: DEN vs SEA → DEN wins (Carlos gets 4 pts - correct!) → 11 + 4 = 15 points
   - Super Bowl: DEN vs SEA → SEA wins (Carlos gets 0 pts - wrong winner) → 11 + 0 = 11 points
   - **Total: 11-15 points** (both scenarios win since no one else can score more than 10)

**Bottom Line:** Carlos is in the driver's seat. He needs DEN to win the AFC Championship (which he picked), and then:
- **If SEA wins NFC:** Super Bowl will be DEN vs SEA (matches his pick!) → Needs DEN to win Super Bowl for 15 points
- **If CHI wins NFC:** Super Bowl will be DEN vs CHI (doesn't match his SEA vs DEN pick) → Still gets 14 points, which is enough to win

## Summary

**Only Carlos can win the pool.** Here's why:

1. **Carlos** is the only contestant who has:
   - The correct matchup for NFC Championship (SEA vs CHI) ✓
   - The correct matchup for AFC Championship (DEN vs NE) ✓
   - A current point total (8) that, combined with potential future points, can beat everyone else

2. **All other contestants** either:
   - Don't have the correct Conference Championship matchups (so they can't earn points)
   - Have correct matchups but their maximum possible score is still lower than Carlos's potential

3. **Carlos's Path to Victory:**
   - If DEN wins AFC Championship → Carlos gets 3 points (11 total)
   - If CHI wins NFC Championship → Carlos gets 3 points (11 total)
   - If CHI wins NFC and DEN wins AFC → Carlos gets 6 points (14 total)
   - If SEA wins NFC and DEN wins AFC → Carlos gets 3 points, then if Super Bowl is DEN vs SEA and DEN wins → Carlos gets 4 more points (15 total)

**The race is essentially over** - Carlos has a commanding lead and the only path to victory. The remaining games will determine his final score, but he cannot be caught.

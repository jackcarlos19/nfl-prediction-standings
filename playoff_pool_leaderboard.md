## Scoring Rules

### "Correct Matchup" Rule
To earn points for a given round, you must correctly pick both the **winning team** AND ensure that the **matchup you predicted** for that round actually occurred.

- **Wild Card Round (1 Point per game):** Matchups are predetermined by seeds. You earn 1 point for each correct winner.
- **Divisional Round (2 Points per game):** You only earn 2 points if the matchup occurred **and** you picked the correct winner.
- **Conference Championships (3 Points per game):** You only earn 3 points if the matchup occurred **and** you picked the correct winner.
- **Super Bowl (4 Points):** You earn 4 points only if you predicted both teams **and** the correct winner.

## Scoring Rules

### "Correct Matchup" Rule
To earn points for a given round, you must correctly pick both the **winning team** AND ensure that the **matchup you predicted** for that round actually occurred.

- **Wild Card Round (1 Point per game):** Matchups are predetermined by seeds. You earn 1 point for each correct winner.
- **Divisional Round (2 Points per game):** You only earn 2 points if:
  - The two teams you picked to play each other actually end up playing each other, AND
  - You correctly picked the winner of that specific game.
- **Conference Championships (3 Points per game):** You earn 3 points if the two teams you predicted reach the championship game are actually there and you pick the correct winner.
- **Super Bowl (4 Points):** You earn 4 points only if you correctly predict the two teams that reach the Super Bowl and you select the correct overall winner.

## Spotlight: Top Performers

### 🥇 **Carlos** (8 points | 87.46% Win Probability | 1:7 Odds)
Leading the pack with a dominant performance! Carlos nailed both AFC divisional matchups perfectly (DEN over BUF, NE over HOU) for 4 critical points. Combined with 4 wild card correct picks, he's positioned strongly heading into the championship rounds. With a commanding 8-point lead, Carlos has an **87.46% chance** to win the pool based on simulation analysis of all possible remaining outcomes.

### 🥈 **Ruben** (5 points | 12.54% Win Probability | 7:1 Odds)
Despite trailing by 3 points, Ruben is the only other contestant mathematically capable of catching Carlos based on the remaining games and their bracket picks. Ruben's 5 wild card correct picks keep him in contention with a **12.54% chance** to win if the remaining games fall perfectly in his favor.

### 🥉 **Bere** (6 points | 42.9% Complete)
Solid showing with 4 wild card picks correct and 2 divisional points. Bere's strategic picks have earned 6 points, but based on the simulation, they cannot mathematically win the pool given their bracket structure and the remaining matchups.

## What's Next?

**Conference Championships (3 points each):**
- **NFC Championship:** (1) Seattle Seahawks vs. (2) Chicago Bears
- **AFC Championship:** (1) Denver Broncos vs. (2) New England Patriots

**Super Bowl LX (4 points):**
- Winner of NFC Championship vs. Winner of AFC Championship

With 10 points still on the table, Carlos has a commanding lead, but the championship rounds will determine the final winner!

**Simulation Methodology:** Win probabilities calculated using 100,000 Monte Carlo simulations with equal probability (50/50) for each remaining game. Each simulation tests all possible combinations of Conference Championship and Super Bowl outcomes, calculating final scores for all contestants and determining the winner(s) based on highest point total. Ties are split equally among tied winners. Only Carlos and Ruben have paths to victory based on their current scores and remaining bracket predictions.
